# Basic Syntax in Python:
Contains all of the note and basic syntax used in Python practice at day 1

## Print

**Print** will print the result out

Examples:

When typing _print "Hello World"_

```Python
print "Hello"

s = "Printing using variables"

print s
```

## Rule for Identifiers:

- Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

- Starting an identifier with 2 leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

- If the identifier also ends with 2 trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
