# Expressions and Variables

## Expressions: Mathematical Operations

Expressions describe a type of operation the computers perform. Expressions are operation the computers perform, for example, basic arithmetic operations.

  - 16 + 40 - 30 * 2

The number is called operands and the math symbols like "+", "-", or "*" are called the operators.

In Python 3, the result of these calculation will be as a float.

The expressions in the parenthesis are performed first.

## Variables

Variables can be used to store the value. For example:

 - my_variable=1 means my_variable:1 (colon is used to denote the value of the variable)

The value of the variable can be changed over time

We can use the type command for the valuable as well. For Example:

  - type(my_variable):int
